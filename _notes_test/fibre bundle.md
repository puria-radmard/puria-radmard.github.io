A [[bundle]] $(E, \pi, M)$ is called a fibre bundle if all [[fibre]]s are [[topologically isomorphic]] to some [[topological manifold]] $F$, i.e.$$\forall p \in M: \text{preim}_\pi(\{p\}) \cong_\text{top} F$$
The [[product bundle]] with [[base space]] being one of the product operands is a fibre bundle with $F=N$, the other product operand
