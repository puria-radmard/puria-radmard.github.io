The (cross-)section of a [[bundle]] $(E, \pi, M)$ is a map $\sigma: M\mapsto E$ if $\pi\circ\sigma=\text{id}_M$, sort of like an inverse but really, dangerously not really, because of the [[surjective]] property of the bundle map.

Basically, a bundle section will send any point in the [[base space]] back to its own [[fibre]] in the [[total space]]

The example for a [[product bundle]] is trivial: $\sigma(p) = (p, s(p))\ \forall\ p\in M$
