This is simply a [[product topology]]-ical space given both operands are actually [[topological manifold]]s. If the operand manifolds have dimensionality $m$ and $n$, the resulting manifold $(M \times N, \mathcal O_{M\times N})$ is of dimension $m+n$.

e.g. the [[2-torus]] is $T^2\times S^1\times S^1$ not just as topoligcal spaces, but as manfiolds too. Same goes for the [[cylinder]]
