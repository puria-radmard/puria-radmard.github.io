- A proposition is boolean variable - always true or false
- An always true one is called a tautology, and an always false one is called a contradiction
- We can define [[logical operators]] over them

- Some keys ideas: 
	- [[ex falso quod libet]]
	- [[proof by contradition and intuitionist logic]]
