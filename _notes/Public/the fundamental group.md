The fundamental group  \(\pi_1(p) := \mathscr L_p\sim\)  of the [[topological space]]  \((M, \mathcal O)\)  at a point  \(p\in M\)  is the [[quotient set]] of the [[space of loops]] brought about by [[homotopic curves]] equivalence.

Clearly, because of the continuity of deformation between [[homotopic curves]], this is a valid [[equivalence relation]].

Its [[group operation]] is represenative concatenation  \([\gamma]\bullet[\delta] = [\gamma\ast\delta]\)  (as defined in: [[space of loops]])

It is also clear to see that this group operation is well-defined, i.e. it doesn't matter which representative you use from the class, the resulting class is the same.

There are some nice [[group isomorphism]] that arise for paricular topological spaces. The best way to understand these is to visualise their [[embeddings]]:

1. **[[2-sphere]]** has a trivial fundamental group at every point
	1. IMAGE

2. **The [[cylinder]]** has at all points  \((\pi_p(p), \bullet)\cong_\text{grp} (\mathbb{Z}, +)\) , where the winding number acts as an analogue to the natural numbers

3. **The [[2-torus]]** has at all points  \((\pi_p(p), \bullet)\cong_\text{grp} (\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}, +)\) , where this time the plus is defined pairwise
