Given a set $M$, topology is a set of [[open set]] $\mathcal O \subseteq \mathcal P(M)$ such that:
1. Empty and ful sets are open $\emptyset, M \in \mathcal O$
2. Closed under **finite** intersection $U, V \in \mathcal O \implies U \cap V \in \mathcal O$
3. Closed under **arbitrary** union $C\subseteq\mathcal O\implies\cup C\in\mathcal O$

The space itself is then denoted $(M, \mathcal O)$

Key/trivial examples: 
- [[the chaotic topology]]
- [[the discrete topology]]

Constructing toplogies:
- [[induced topology]]
- [[quotient topology]]
- [[product topology]]
