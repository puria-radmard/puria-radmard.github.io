After understanding the basics of RNNs, [[fixed-point and slow-point analysis]] offers an initial toolkit for analysing the geometry of RNN activity. These analyses are very sensitive however, so some of the results in that section don't look as flattering as the results they are trying to replicate - bear with me!

A generalisation of fixed-point analysis is [[neural manifold analysis]], which studies more complex geometries to which RNN activities adhere.

Another key analysis tool in
