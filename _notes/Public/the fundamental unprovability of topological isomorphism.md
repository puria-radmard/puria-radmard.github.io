There is **no known list** of invariants (e.g. [[T2 (Hausdroff) topological space]], [[compactness]], [[connectedness]], [[the fundamental group]], etc.) such that if [[topological space]]s $(M, \mathcal O_M)$ and $(N, \mathcal O_N)$ share all the items on the list, then we can conclude that they are [[topologically isomorphic]].
