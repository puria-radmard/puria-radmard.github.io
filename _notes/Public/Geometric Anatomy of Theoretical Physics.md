## Chapters

1. **Logic**
	- [[propositional logic]] UNFINISHED
	- [[predicate logic]]
	- [[axiomatic systems and theory of proofs]]

2. **Axioms of set theory**
	-  [[ZFC axioms of set theory]] UNFINISHED 

3. **Classifications between sets**
	- [[the set and space index]] starts here UNFINISHED START
	- [[the map index]] also starts here UNFINISHED START
	- [[equivalence relation]]s
	- [[ZFC set-theoretic constructions of N, Z, Q, and R]] UNFINISHED

4. - 5. **Topological spaces**
	- [[topological space]] and [[the standard topology]]
	- Construction of [[induced topology]] (ADD IMAGE), [[quotient topology]] (ADD IMAGE), [[product topology]]
	- [[convergence]], [[continuity]], and [[homeomorphism]]
	- [[seperation properties]], [[compactness]] and [[paracompactness]]
	- [[partition of unity]]
	- [[connectedness]] and [[path connectedness]] (ADD IMAGE OF SINE)
	- [[the group theory index]] starts here UNFINISHED START - PAGE 37/38
	- [[homotopic curves]] (ADD IMAGE - page 36) and [[the fundamental group]] (ADD IMAGES - ALL)
	- [[the fundamental unprovability of topological isomorphism]]

6. - 7. **Topological manifolds and differentiable structures**
	- [[topological manifold]]s and subtypes
	- [[bundle]]s and all the terminology and subtypes, leading up to [[bundle isomorphism]] and [[local bundle isomorphism]] (ADD IMAGE AT BOTTOM OF PAGE 41 AND DRAWING AT BOTTOM OF PAGE 42 AND DIAGRAM AT BOTTOM OF PAGE 43)
		- Note that from here on, we mostly refer to [[locally trivial bundle]]s
		- Important for later to look at: [[pull-back bundle]]s and [[bundle section]]s on them (ADD IMAGES FROM 44)
	- [[manifold chart]]s, [[manifold atlas]]es and their subtypes, and [[component functions]]/[[local coordinates]]
		- Note that from this point on, we mostly refer to [[smooth manifold]]s
	- [[atlas structure and compatability]], [[differentiable manifolds]] (ADD IMAGES FROM PAGE 50) and [[diffeomorphism]]s
	- [[Radon-Moise Theorem]] and the weirdness of 4 dimensions
	- [[Betti numbers]]

THERE'S KEY NOTE AT PAGE 53 THAT I SHOULD GET IN HERE (ADD IMAGE AS IS TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE)

8. **A very important detour into linear algebra**
	- Aim: build up to tensor spaces over a field
	- [[the linear algebra index]] UNFINISHED

10. - 10. **Tangent vector spaces, cotangent spaces, and the tangent bundle**
	- Different interpretations of [[tangent vector space]]
	- (there is another detour into linear algebra at this point)
	- The [[coordinate induced basis]] of a tangent vector space
	- The [[cotangent space]] and its own [[dual basis]]
	- The [[tensor space]]
	- The [[differential]], [[gradient]], and [[gradient operator]]
	- Redefining the [[cotangent space basis]]
	- [[push-forward]] and [[pull-back]]
	- [[immersions]], [[embeddings]], and [[Whitney's Theorem]]
	- The [[tangent bundle]] and why it is indeed a bundle, via the [[tangent bundle atlas]]
	- Finally, the [[cotangent bundle]]

11. **Tensor spaces over a ring**
