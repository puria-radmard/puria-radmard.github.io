A [[bundle]]  \((E, \pi, M)\)  is called a fibre bundle if all [[fibre]]s are [[topologically isomorphic]] to some [[topological manifold]]  \(F\) , i.e.

\[\forall p \in M: \text{preim}_\pi(\{p\}) \cong_\text{top} F\]


The [[product bundle]] with [[base space]] being one of the product operands is a fibre bundle with  \(F=N\) , the other product operand

\[ \(
