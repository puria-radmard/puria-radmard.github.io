Zemelo Fraenkel (choice) set theory is an axiomatic system (see: [[axiomatic systems and theory of proofs]]) with nine axioms

1. [[the epsilon relation axiom]]
2. [[the empty set existance axiom]]
3. [[the axiom on pair sets]]
4. [[the axiom on union sets]]
5. [[the axiom of replacement]]
6. [[the power set existance axiom]]
7. [[the axiom of infinity]]
8. [[the axiom of choice]] - key to ZFC set theory
9. [[the axiom of foundation]]

Key concept that follows: [[the principle of restricted comprehension]]
