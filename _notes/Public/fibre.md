Given [[bundle]] $(E, \pi, M)$ and a point in the [[base space]] $p\in M$, the fibre at that point is simply [[the preimage]] of the map:$$F_p:=\text{preim}_\pi(\{p\})$$
Because the map is [[surjective]], $F_p \neq \emptyset\ \forall p\in M$ 

This image took me a while to understand, but I think it represents the base space as embedded in the the [[total space]] $E$, and the fiber $F_p\subset E$ is all the points in the total space that are "attached" to the point by the surjection.
