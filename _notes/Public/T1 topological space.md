A [[topological space]] $(M, \mathcal O)$ is T1 if for every point pair, an [[open neighbourhood]] can be found such that only one is a member , i.e. $$\forall p, q \in M: p\neq q\implies \exists U(p)\in\mathcal O: q\notin U(p)$$
i.e. $U(p)\cap\{q\}=\emptyset$.

This is weaker than the [[T2 (Hausdroff) topological space]] condition

The [[Zariski topology]] is T1 but not T2

Clearly, [[the chaotic topology]] is not T1
