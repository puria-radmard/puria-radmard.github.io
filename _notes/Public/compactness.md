A [[topological space]] $(M, \mathcal O)$ is compact if every *open* [[cover]] has a *finite* [[subcover]]

An [[induced topology]] $\mathcal O_N$ on $N\subseteq M$ is a *compact subspace* if $(N, \mathcal O|_N)$ is compact. The subset $N$ is also called compact

The [[Heine-Borel Theorem]] makes it easy to identify compact subsets in a [[metric space]]

Compactness is preserved under [[homeomorphism]]s and creation of [[product topology]]

i.e. if $(M, \mathcal O_M)$ and $(N, \mathcal O_N)$ are compact topological spaces, then $(M\times N, \mathcal O_{M\times N})$ is also a compact topological space, and so are any number of products.

Compactness is often too strong, so we use [[paracompactness]]
