Manifold-targeted RNNs are an attempt at reverse engineering [[neural manifold analysis]], by exploiting [[RNN connectivity]] to generate a network whose activity is constrained to some topology, geometry, or some other structured subspace in the neural [[state-space]].

A later, but very good starting point to understand these is [[Claudi and Branco, 2022]]. Other key approaches are [[low-rank RNNs]] and [[Embedding Manifolds with Population-level Jacobians]]
