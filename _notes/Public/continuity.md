#### Topological definition

For [[topological space]]s $(M, \mathcal O_M)$ and $(N, \mathcal O_N)$, a [[continuous map]] $\phi: M\mapsto N$ is continuous w.r.t. the topologies by [[the preimage]]:$$
\forall S\in\mathcal O_N, \text{preim}_\phi(S)\in\mathcal O_M
$$i.e. open sets can be matched up (not nec. 1-to-1, see: [[homeomorphism]])

If either space is equipped with [[the chaotic topology]], then any map is continuous

As with [[convergence]], using the [[the standard topology]] for both spaces gives the standard [[open ball]] definition of continuity in measure theory...
