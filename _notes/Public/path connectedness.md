A  [[topological space]] $(M, \mathcal O)$ is *path-connected* if

$$
\forall p, q\in M: \exists\gamma:[0,1]\mapsto M: (\gamma(0)=p) \land (\gamma(1)=q)
$$


where $\gamma$ is a *continuous curve*, with [[continuity]] defined on [[the standard topology]] of the domain $[0,1]$

Of course, [[the standard topology]] on Euclidean space is path connected.

This is weaker than [[connectedness]], i.e. path-connected spaces are all connected, but not nec vice versa. This is clear when considering what it means for $\gamma$ to be continuous.
For example:
