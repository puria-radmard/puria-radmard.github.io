From [[Brady et al., 2016 - Real-world Objects]]:
	"a sustained negative deflection in the [[event-related potential]] (ERP) that occurs during the retention period over the hemisphere contralateral to the to-be-remembered items \[in a [[working memory]] task\] and is typically largest over [[parietal-occipital scalp sites]]"

Also cited in that study, CDA has:
1. magnitude increases with number of items in working memory (see: [[set-size effect]])
2. decreases when items are dropped from working memory
3. correlates with individual's [[working memory capacity]]
4. dissapperas when items have been consolidated into [[episodic memory]] (long-term)

Often measured as "*contralateral-minus-ipsilateral waveforms*" to account for baseline
