Define two measures $\mu, \nu$ on $(\mathcal X, \mathcal B)$, i.e. $\mathcal X$ and its [[sigma-algebra]]

$\nu$ is absolutely continuous wrt $\mu$ if $\nu(A) = 0\ \forall A\in\mathcal B\ s.t. \mu(A) = 0$

In other words, $\mu(A) = 0 \implies \nu(A) = 0$, i.e. any ([[measurable]]) where that $\mu$ measures zero, $\nu$ also measures zero

This is denoted: $\nu \ll \mu$

Furthermore: if $\nu(\mathcal X) \lt\inf$ , then $\nu \ll \mu$ means the stronger statement: $\forall\epsilon\gt 0,\ \exists\ \delta \gt 0\ s.t.\ \mu(A)\lt\delta\implies\nu(A)\lt\epsilon$  

This follows from the [[Radon-Nikodym theorm]]
