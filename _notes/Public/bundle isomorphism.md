This is a [[bundle morphism]] which are also [[homeomorphism]]s. 

Just as homeomorphisms are the structure-preserving maps between [[topological spaces]]s, this is the structure-preserving map for [[bundle]]s.

That means that if there exists a bundle isomorphism between bundles $(E, \pi, M)$ and $(E', \pi', M')$, we denote it as $$(E, \pi, M)\cong_\text{bdl}(E', \pi', M')$$
See this figure:

XXX

Note that the pairs of manifolds can be [[topologically isomorphic]], but fail to have a bundle morphisms, because we need [[diagram commutes]].
- e.g., [[Mobius strip]] and [[cylinder]]. The [[base space]]s are both $S^1$ and (I think) the [[total space]]s are also homeomorphic, but the 'twist' is encoded in the projection map, so as bundles they are not isomorphic

Sometimes, this is too strong a condition, so we instead just require a [[local bundle isomorphism]]
