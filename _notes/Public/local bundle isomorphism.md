Just as [[topological manifold]]s only have local [[homeomorphism]]s to Euclidean space, which is a weaker version of [[topologically isomorphic]]-ism, we also require a weaker version of [[bundle isomorphism]].

A [[bundle]]  \((E, \pi, M)\)  is locally isomorphic (as a bundle) to another bundle  \((E', \pi', M')\)  if for every point  \(p\in M\)  in its [[base space]] there is an [[open neighbourhood]]  \(U(p)\)  such that the [[restricted bundle]] on that neighbourhood satisfies: 

\[(\text{preim}_\pi(U(p)), \piert_{\text{preim}_\pi(U(p))}, U(p)) \cong_\text{bdl} (E', \pi', M')\]

i.e. the [[restricted bundle]] on that neighbourgood s isomorphic (as a bundle) to  \((E', \pi', M')\) .
