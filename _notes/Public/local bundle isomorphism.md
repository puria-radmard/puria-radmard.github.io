Just as [[topological manifold]]s only have local [[homeomorphism]]s to Euclidean space, which is a weaker version of [[topologically isomorphic]]-ism, we also require a weaker version of [[bundle isomorphism]].

A [[bundle]] $(E, \pi, M)$ is locally isomorphic (as a bundle) to another bundle $(E', \pi', M')$ if for every point $p\in M$ in its [[base space]] there is an [[open neighbourhood]] $U(p)$ such that the [[restricted bundle]] on that neighbourhood satisfies: $$(\text{preim}_\pi(U(p)), \pi|_{\text{preim}_\pi(U(p))}, U(p)) \cong_\text{bdl} (E', \pi', M')$$i.e. the [[restricted bundle]] on that neighbourgood s isomorphic (as a bundle) to $(E', \pi', M')$.
