An equivalence relation is any [[relation]] defined on set $M$, with standard binary [[logical operators]] notation (i.e. $a\sim b := \sim(a,b)$), which satisfies the following properties:

1. Reflexivity, i.e. $\forall m \in M: m \sim m$. All items are equivalent to themselves
2. Symmetry, i.e. $\forall m, n \in M: m\sim n \implies n\sim m$
3. Transitivity, i.e. $\forall m, n, p \in M: (m \sim n \land n  \sim p) \implies m \sim p$

The last one allows us to define [[equivalence class]]es, and [[quotient set]]s
