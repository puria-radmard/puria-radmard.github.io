A key background are the basic [[synaptic plasticity rules in Dayan and Abbot]]

At Cosyne 2023 I met SarayÂ Soldado-Magraner, who developed a combined homeostatic and cross-homeostatic plasticity rule to deal with the instability of paradoxical self-sustained dynamics: [[Soldado-Magraner, et al. 2022]]

For more appreciation of this work check out:
- [[Sussillo and Abbot 2009 (notebook)]] which combines synaptic plasticity with [[fixed-point and slow-point analysis]]
- [[Agnes and Vogels 2021 (notebook)]] which looks at [[codependent plasticity]] rules
- [[Mackwood et al. 2021 (notebook)]]

I also spoke toRichard Gast, who provided a "[[mean field approximation]] of networks of spiking neurons with short-term synaptic plasticity": [[Gast, et al. 2021]]
