Two [[smooth manifold]]s $(M, \mathcal O_M, \mathscr A_M)$ and $(N, \mathcal O_N, \mathscr A_N)$ are called diffeomophic, i.e. 

\[(M, \mathcal O_M, \mathscr A_M)\cong_\text{diff}(N, \mathcal O_N, \mathscr A_N)\]


or more simply: 

\[M\cong_\text{diff}N\]


if there exists a [[diffeomorphism]] between them.

This is an [[equivalence relation]], and often we consider two diffeomorphic smooth mainfolds to be *the same*. A natural question is how many unique smooth manifolds can exist? The answer is bizarre: [[Radon-Moise Theorem]]
