The BA course [[3F2: Systems and Control]] was an amazing introduction to traditional control methods, such as [[pole placement]]

The MEng course [[4F3: An Optimisation-Based Approach to Control]] extended to [[H2 control]], [[H-inf control]], and the [[HJB equations]] in general

(Two books from Guillaume as courses, infinite dimension book also!)
