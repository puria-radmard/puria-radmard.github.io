The earliest theory I've read on uncertainty representation is on [[doubly distributional population codes]]

This is followed by [[probabilistic population codes]]

A generative model that follows the DDCs was the [[distributed distributional code Helmholtz machine]]

[[uncertainty representation - experimental index]]
