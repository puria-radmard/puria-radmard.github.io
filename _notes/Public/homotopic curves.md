Given a [[topological space]] $(M, \mathcal O)$, two curves $\gamma, \delta: [0, 1]\mapsto M$ with the same start and end points are called *homotopic* if:\[
\exists h: [0,1]\times[0,1]\mapsto M: \forall\lambda\in[0,1]: (h(0,\lambda)=\gamma(\lambda))\land(h(1,\lambda)=\delta(\lambda))
\]
where $h$ is continuous ([[continuity]] defined on [[product topology]] for the domain).

Homotopy is an [[equivalence relation]], and it is used to define [[the fundamental group]].

This means $h$ can deform one curve into the other, with the first parameter controlling the deformation:
