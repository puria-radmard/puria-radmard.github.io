"A subset of $\mathbb R^d$ equipped with [[the standard topology]] is compact iff it is a closed (see: [[open set]]) and [[bounded subset]]"

See how a subset can be compact: [[compactness]]

With the definition of the [[open ball]] involved, we need to see Euclidean space as a [[metric space]]. This can be generalised to any [[metric-induced topology]]
