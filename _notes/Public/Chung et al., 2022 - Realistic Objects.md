- **Core finding**
	- Working memory capacity goes up when colours are part of recognisable real-world objects rather than unrecognisable objects
	- Task = [[2AFC]] of various kinds (Figure 1), with stimuli presented sequentially or spatially
	- Real = clothing and accessories in different colours
	- Unreal = images but with complete distortion
	
	- Also: same effect for inverted images (Figure 2D)
	- This suggests the recognisability of the stimulus is directly responsible

- See also: [[Brady et al., 2016 - Real-world Objects]] for why this is actually [[working memory]] and not some kind of [[semantic memory]]

- Thoughts: [[Xie et al., 2022 - CNN-RNN]] could do with seeing if [[set-size effect]] stll stands if the cues are generated from some kind of [[generative model]] based on the pretrained CNN
