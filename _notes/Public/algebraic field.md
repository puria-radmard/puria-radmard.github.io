A algebraic field is a set equipped with an addition and a multiplication function: $(K, +, \cdot)$

Both operations are $K\times K\mapsto K$, and follow the following axioms:
1. $(K, +)$ is an [[abelian group]] with neutral element 0
2. $(K\backslash\{0\}, \cdot)$ is also an abelian group with neutral element 1
3. The maps follow the distributive property: $\forall a,b,c\in K: (a+b)\cdot c = a\cdot c+b\cdot c$

Example, $(\mathbb R, +_\mathbb R, \cdot_\mathbb R)$, as you'd expect!
