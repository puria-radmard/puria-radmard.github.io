##### A paracompact, Hausdroff, topological space $(M, \mathcal O)$ is called a d-dimensional topological manifold if $\forall p\in M, \exists$ an (open) neighbourhood $U(p)$ and a homeomorphism to Euclidean space: $x: U(p)\mapsto x(U(p))\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$

Defintions for this definition:
- [[paracompactness]]
- [[T2 (Hausdroff) topological space]]
- [[topological space]]
- [[open neighbourhood]]
- [[homeomorphism]]

The manifold has [[dimensionality]] $\dim M = d$. The concept must be *well defined* - if you have a manifold $(M, \mathcal O)$ and two intersecting neighbourhoods, then the Euclidean spaces to which they are homeomorphic must have the same dimension.

Intuitively, we say that manifolds "locally look like" Euclidean space. An equivalent defintition exists for [[complex topological manifold]] (the above definition is strictly speaking a real topological manifold)

It follows that you can look at manifolds by these neighbourhood homeomorphism to Euclidean space, i.e. through  [[manifold chart]]s, [[manifold atlas]]es, and [[local coordinates]]
