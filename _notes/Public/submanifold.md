Given a [[topological manifold]] and a subset $N\subseteq M$. The [[induced topology]]-ical space $(N, \mathcal O|_N)$ is a submanifold of $M$ iff it is also a manifold in its own right.

e.g. $S^1$ is a submanifold of $\mathbb R^2$, while the [[2-sphere]], [[cylinder]], and [[2-torus]] are submanifolds of $\mathbb R^3$
