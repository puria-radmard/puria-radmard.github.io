Recall the definition of an [[algebraic field]]

A ring is also a set equipped with an addition and a multiplication function: $(R, +, \cdot)$. 

This time:
1. $(R, +)$ is still an [[abelian group]] with neutral element 0
2. $\cdot$ is still associative for $R\backslash\{0\}$, i.e. $(a\cdot b)\cdot c = a\cdot(b\cdot c)$
3. The maps are distributive as previously defined

The other abelian group properties need not apply to $\cdot$, but if they do you can have [[unital ring]]s and [[commutative ring]]s
