A map $\phi:A\mapsto B$ between two sets is really a [[relation]], i.e. $\forall a\in A: \exists !b\in B: \phi(a, b)$
i.e. for each member of the *domain* there is one member of the *target aka codomain* satisfies the relation.

Notationally, it is easier to say $phi(a) :=b: \phi(a,b)$

Using [[the principle of restricted comprehension]], we can define the *image* of the domain under the map, namely:
- $\phi(A) \equiv \text{im}_{\phi}(A) := \{\phi(a) | a \in A\}$
