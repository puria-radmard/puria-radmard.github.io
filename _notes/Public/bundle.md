A bundle of [[topological manifold]]s is a triple $$(E, \pi, M)$$, where:
- $$E$$ is the [[total space]] - a manifold
- $$M$$ is the [[base space]] - a manifold
- $$\pi$$ is the projection map - a [[surjective]], [[continuous map]] $$\pi: E\mapsto M$$

Bundles can be seen as a generalisation of [[product manifold]]s. Consider the [[Mobius strip]], denoted $$E$$. Locally, it looks like the [[cylinder]], but it is not the same. Actually, it can be seen as the bundle $$(E, \pi, S^1)$$, where $$\pi$$ maps any point to a line along the center of the strip, and the [[fibre]] at each point is $$[0,1]$$. The cylinder cannot be defined in this way.

An example where these definitions combine is the [[product bundle]]

A sort of reversal of the map $$\pi$$ is the [[bundle section]] (definitely not really)

Important types of bundles:
- [[fibre bundle]]s
- [[subbundle]]s
- [[restricted bundle]]s
- [[pull-back bundle]]s
