A [[topological space]] $(M, \mathcal O)$ is Hausdroff if any distinct pair of points have their own entirely disjoint [[open neighbourhood]]s, i.e.

$$
\forall p, q \in M: p\neq q\implies \exists U(p), V(q)\in\mathcal O: U(p) \cap V(q) = \emptyset
$$


All T2 spaces are also [[T1 topological space]]s

On Euclidean space, [[the standard topology]] is Hausdroff

Clearly, [[convergence]] of a sequence in a Hausdroff space means the sequence has a unique limit point.
