For [[topological space]]s $(M, \mathcal O_M)$ and $(N, \mathcal O_N)$, a map $\phi: M\mapsto N$ is a homeomorphism if:
1. It is [[bijective]] (so has a well-defined inverse)
2. It is a [[continuous map]]
3. Its inverse is also a [[continuous map]]

Effectively, this gives a 1-to-1 mapping between open sets

If a homeomorphism exists between two spaces, they are said to be [[topologically isomorphic]]
