A smooth, a.k.a. a $\mathcal C^k$-manifold is the triple $(M, \mathcal O, \mathscr A)$  where $(M, \mathcal O)$ is a [[topological manifold]] and $\mathscr A$ is a $\mathcal C^k$ [[maximal atlas]] (see: [[atlas structure and compatability]])

As noted in [[differentiable manifolds]], maps between smooth manifolds are called smooth maps. These become extremely important in differentiable geometry.
