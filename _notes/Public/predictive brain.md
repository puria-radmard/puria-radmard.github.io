From [[Trapp et al., 2021 - Predictive Brain and STM Capacity]]: 
- "This is the theory that the brain is 'proactive' - it does not rely purely on bottom-up (sensory) information, but also adds 'expectations' during [[active inference]]"

- "Incoming sensory input is compared with prior information or predictions, and *only deviations/prediction errors* are actually fed forward into the sensory hierarchy"

Closely related to the [[free-energy principle]]

Under this framework, [[attention]] is seen as a mechanism for weighting important information for predictions and prediction errors

Similarly, [[long-term memory]] is seen as "a system to provide prerequisites for the simulation of future events" - see the [[future-first hypothesis]]. See Trapp et al., 2021 for concordant views on STM

Key open questions:
1. How is sensory information compared to prior expectations
2. How are priors retrieved from LTM and made accessible
3. What is their representation format?
