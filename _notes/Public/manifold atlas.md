A collection of [[chart]]s on a [[topological manifold]] where the [[open neighbourhood]]s [[cover]] the manifold itself exactly, i.e.

$$\mathscr A:= \{(U_\alpha, x_\alpha)|\alpha\in \mathcal A\}$$

 such that 

$$\bigcup_{\alpha\in\mathcal A}U_\alpha = M$$


You automatically have a "$\mathcal C^0$-atlas", meaning all constitutent charts are pairwise [[C0-compatible]]. See: [[maximal atlas]].
However, we may wish to add more structure to the atlas: [[atlas structure and compatability]]

An atlas helps us consider manifolds in terms of more 'physical' Euclidean space. For example, checks for [[continuity]] of functions can be done via their charts, as can curves on the manifold can be defined as smooth.

The [[transition map]]s between charts allow you to forget about the 'inner structure' of the manifold itself, and just consider Euclidean space. Concepts related to differentiability are much easier to manipulate here.
