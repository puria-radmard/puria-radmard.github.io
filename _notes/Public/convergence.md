#### Toplogical definition

For [[topological space]] $(M, \mathcal O)$, and a sequence $q_{1:\infty}$ is said to "*converge against a limit point* $a\in M$" if all [[open neighbourhood]]s of $a$ contain all sequence points after some $q_N$: $$
\forall U\in\mathcal O: a\in U \implies \exists N\in\mathbb N: \forall n > N: q(n)\in U
$$
in a way, through the lens of the topology, the sequence becomes indistinguishable from the limit point.

In [[the chaotic topology]], convergence is vacuous.

In [[the discrete topology]], convergence requires $q_n = a$ after some $N$.

In [[the standard topology]] (and generalised versions with other definitions of the [[open ball]]), this becomes the same as the measure theoretic definitions...
