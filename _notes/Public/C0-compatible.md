Following the generic definition of [[transition map compatability]], two [[manifold chart]]s are $\mathcal C^0$-compatible if *either*:

- They do not intersect: $U\cap V = \emptyset$
- They have a continuous [[transition map]]: 

\[(y\circ x^{-1}): x(U\cap V)\mapsto y(U\cap V)\]


This is an $\mathbb R^d\mapsto\mathbb R^d$ map, so [[continuity]] is defined in [[the standard topology]] way.
