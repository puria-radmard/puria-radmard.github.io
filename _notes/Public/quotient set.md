Given a set $$M$$ and [[equivalence relation]] $$\sim$$, the quotient set is the set of all [[equivalence class]]es, i.e.: 

$$M/\sim := \{[m] \in \mathcal P(M) ert m\in M\}$$

as can be generated by [[the principle of restricted comprehension]]

As per [[the axiom of choice]], one can define a [[set-theoretic isomorphic]] *system of representatives*, with a choice of one item from each equivalence class, $$R\cong_\text{set}M/\sim$$

**Example**
- $$M = \mathbb Z$$
- $$m\sim n:\implies n-m\in 2\mathbb Z$$, i.e. odd vs. even
- Hence $$M/\sim = \{[0], [1]\}$$ and we can have $$R = {0, 1}$$, for example
- Nice aside: we can define  $$\oplus: M/\sim \times M/\sim \mapsto M/\sim$$ as $$[a]\oplus[b] := [a+b]$$, and this is consistent, as in doesn't depend on the representation you use $$a', b'$$ and get the same output
- This is a set theoretic definition of modulo-2 addition!
