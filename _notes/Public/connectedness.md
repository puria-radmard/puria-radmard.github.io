**Intuitive definition:** [[topological space]] $(M, \mathcal O_M)$ is connected unless $\exists A, B \in\mathcal O: (A\cap B = \emptyset) \land (M = A\cup B)$

e.g. the [[induced topology]]-ical space $(\mathbb R\backslash\{0\}, \mathcal O_\text{std}\vert_{\mathbb R\backslash\{0\}})$ is not connected

**Intuitive result**: $(M, \mathcal O_M)$ connected iff the only [[open set]]s that are *also closed* are $M$ and $\emptyset$
- Forward: contradiction examples follows immediately
- Backward: similar idea
