**Introductory notes from Kemp and Tenenbaum, 2008, which is the earliest I've seen these techniques. For the implementation of this paper, see [[Kemp and Tenenbaum, 2008 (notebook)]]**

The discovery of underlying structure in a dataset typically involes a two-tiered task:
- Higher level: discovery of the *form* $$F$$ of the underlying structure
- Lower level: discovery of the *instance of this form* $$S$$ (for structure) which best explains this data ($$D$$)

The Bayesian way to solve such a problem is to assume a [[generative model]] of the data: 

$$S, F = \arg\max\left\{ P(DertS) P(SertF) P(F) \right\}$$


**Prior over forms $$P(F)$$**
- This prior over forms is uniform over selected forms
- Selected forms are generated by [[graph grammars]]

**Prior over structure $$P(SertF)$$**
- So far, we have made no comment on even the number of clusters (nodes) in the graph
- We want this prior over instances of the form to favour small number of clusters
- $$P(SertF) \propto \tilde P(SertF) = \theta^k$$ is used, where $$k$$ is the number of clusters/nodes, and $$\theta$$ is a hyperparameters
- This prior implicitly favours simpler forms, $$F$$.
	- The actual prior, with [[partition function]], is 

$$P(SertF) = \frac{\tilde P(SertF)}{\sum_{T\in\mathcal S_k(F)}\tilde P(TertF)}$$


	- More complex $$F$$ will have larger $$\mathcal S(F)$$, so will tend to have smaller $$P(SertF)$$, even if the structure is the same
	- e.g. every chain is a grid (with one row), however there are more possible grids ($$ert\mathcal S_k(\text{grid})ert \gt ert\mathcal S_k(\text{chain})ert$$) for the same $$k$$, so an underlying chain is prefered
	- The grid will be chosen only if it is substatially better for the data...

**Likelihood over data $$P(DertS)$$**
- So far, we have made no comment on the roles of vertices between nodes
- The likeihood will be high if features of $$D$$ vary *smoothly* across $$S$$
- How exactly this is done is quite involved, and will be covered in the notebook
