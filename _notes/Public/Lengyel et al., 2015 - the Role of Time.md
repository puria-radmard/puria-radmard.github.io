Estimation error and uncertainty change, and their correlations, change over time in perceptual DM tasks.

This paper compares two orthogonal models for this change over time:

1. **Evidence Integration (EI)**: consider the [[accumulation of sensory information]], i.e. the posterior changes over time, and at each time the posterior is being represented exactly.  The model is 'honing in' on the true posterior.
2. **Probabilistic Sampling**: the posterior does not change over time, but is being represented by MC samples, and the overall representation improves in quality over time

Rest of the paper based on line *drawing* task, where length of line represents reported uncertainty. Has to be read to be understood in full!
