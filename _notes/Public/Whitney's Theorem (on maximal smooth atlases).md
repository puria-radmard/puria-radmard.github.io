**Theorem:**
- Any maximal $\mathcal C^k$-atlas with $k\geq1$ contains a $\mathcal C^\infty$-atlas.
- Any two maximal $\mathcal C^k$-atlas that contain the same $\mathcal C^\infty$-atlas are identical

**Definitions required**:
- [[maximal atlas]]
- [[atlas structure and compatability]]

**Implications**:
- As soon as you can find a $\mathcal C^1$ [[manifold atlas]], you have a [[smooth manifold]]
