Neural manifold analysis refers to the analysis of the subspace of N (number of neurons) dimensional space to which neural network activity limits itself. 

This phenomenon has been observed in both [[Recurrent Neural Networks]] and in [[Spike Data Analysis]]

One key hypothesis here is that the "geometry and topology of the neural manifold is linked in a fundamental way to the computations carried out by the network" ([[Claudi and Branco, 2022]]). A key question then is how to engineer network connectivity to generate [[manifold-targted RNNs]], and the subsequent analysis that can be done on them.
