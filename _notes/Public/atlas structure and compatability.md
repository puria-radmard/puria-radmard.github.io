**Structure**
As noted, a [[manifold atlas]] on a [[topological manifold]] is already a $\mathcal C^0$-atlas.

This is because any "valid" [[transition map]] between two [[chart]]s in the atlas are [[C0-compatible]].

However, you can extend this definition to any of the examples listed in: [[transition map compatability]]. 

For each example of $\bullet$-compatible charts, the atlas is called a $\bullet$-atlas, or equivalent.
For example when $\bullet = \mathcal C^\infty$, we have a [[smooth atlas]] for a [[smooth manifold]]

**Compatability**
There is also a concept of compatability *between* atlases: Two $\bullet$-atlases $\mathscr A$ and $\mathscr B$ of the same manifold are compatible if $\mathscr A\cup \mathscr B$ is again a $\bullet$-atlas, incompatible otherwise.
