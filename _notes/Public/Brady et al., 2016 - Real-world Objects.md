A nice companion to [[Chung et al., 2022 - Realistic Objects]], but with neural data.

The important part is that this paper aims to 'prove' that the boost in [[working memory capacity]] provided by the realistic objects is indeed [[working memory]] and not just [[semantic memory]] or [[episodic memory]].

Key neural measurements used to do this: [[contralateral delay activity]] (CDA) - see that page for the 4 key properties of CDA that are used in this argument.

**Experiment 1**
- For simple coloured blocks, [[working memory capacity]] does not improve with encoding time
- For simple real-world objects, and real-world objects with detail, it does

**Experiment 2**
- For the real-world objects, longer coding times are indeed coupled with larger CDA magnitude

**Experiment 3**
- A new WM task is used here, which requires holding multiple items at a time in memory
- Similar observations as before - CDA magnitude larger for objects, rather than colours
