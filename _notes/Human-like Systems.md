- It can be more insightful to train systems that make the same mistakes than do humans, rather than optimising to a task as best as possible

- To understand how to build such systems, it is important to understand where human suoptimality comes from: [[human uncertainty and suboptimality - experimental index]]

- Also relevant: [[uncertainty representation - experimental index]]

- And of course: [[animal-like neural networks - approaches index]]

- Key model: [[resource model of working memory]]
